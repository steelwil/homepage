<p><em>2009-07-18</em> Bought some more fish five female golden gouramis, three cat fish, two algae eaters and two flying foxes. One gourami got hurt after getting stuck in the plumbing so I also had to change this to prevent this from happening again. One of the original three gouramis died. The vals were pretty thick so I thinned this out a bit and added some more <em>other</em> plants.</p>

<p>I really wish I could get some Siamese Algae eaters. I may also have to get the CO<sub>2</sub> going again.</p>

<p><em>2009-01-05</em> Unbelievable but the tank is still going, it still has the same three female golden gouramis.</p>

<p><em>2005-11-08</em> Added a pic of my <a href="fishtank.jpg">tank.</a> It is still early days but starting to look like something. It is populated by three female golden gouramis. I am also experimenting with sodium biphosphate to lower the pH. I have had no adverse effects so far.</p>

<p><em>2005-06-16</em> I started rebuilding the tank.</p>

<p><em>2005-03-17:</em> The tank is a disaster right now, I need to rebuild the whole thing. At the moment I have some guppies in the tank. </p>

<p><em>2003-03-14:</em> The tank is doing quite well considering the effort I put in. I have 3 White Cloud Tetras left. Some time ago I bought some Dwarfed Gouramis they had a disease and killed all the other fish.</p>

<p><em>2001-10-21:</em> The tank is doing quite well. I have added nine White Cloud Tetras. I have got rid of almost all algae with the help of Carbon Dioxide. My plants did show signs of deficiency
due to the explosive growth as a result of the Carbon Dioxide. So I added a modified version of PMDD (one without iron) every few days. I also placed a piece of red clay (for iron) in the substrate
by the affected plants. Then tank has been without CO<sub>2</sub> for two weeks and the hair algae has returned so I'll be once again putting the tank on CO<sub>2</sub> Ideally the tank should not
run with it, as it adds a lot of extra maintenance. (Trimming, fertilizing and making CO<sub>2</sub> brew). On a recent trip to the Vaal River I saw a lot of the very hair algae I have in my
tanks.</p>

<p><em>2001-03-03:</em> I have moved again. I still have a problem with thread algae. I am reducing the pH of the tank from about 7.6 to below 7 so that the algae can be deprived of its alkaline
advantage.</p>

<p><em>2001-01-05:</em> The tank is doing much better. One of the fry has survived and is doing well. I have bought a new female Gourami. I still have a problem with thread algae. The male Gourami
loves it and uses a lot of the stuff to build his nest. The nest is very strong and is about a week or two old. The fish have spawned but I have not seen any fry yet.</p>

<p><em>2000-12-03:</em> Setback: The tank turned into a Val jungle. I removed all Val plants, upsetting the substrate. I obtained 3 Dwarf Gouramis, they spawned but the 2 females died of a fungal
infection. The male is still recovering. I doubt any fry has survived.</p>

<p><em>2000-11-18:</em> The plants are doing great. I have developed a problem with green thread algae.</p>

<p><em>2000-11-11:</em> My tank is starting to do nicely now. Its two weeks into cycling and I have had no algae blooms yet. At the moment it is still fish less. I intend to stock it with Dwarf
Gouramis&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I was using the phosphate limited approach and I achieved marginal success. I am now doing the low tech natural approach. I have recently read Diana Walstad's book the <a
href="http://www.aquatic-gardeners.org/bookstore.html">Ecology of the Planted Aquarium</a> (also available at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0967377307/o/qid=972649217/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/002-7767879-3120837">Amazon.com</a>) describing this technique. I would recommend this
book to anybody interested in a planted aquarium.</p>

<h4>How I started this damn hobby</h4>

<p>My dad bought a 3-foot tank. He soon lost interest and I felt sorry for the fish. I soon realized that this is not as easy as it looks, why could I not reproduce what I saw it the books? Why
don&rsquo;t these books tell me anything?</p>

<h4>What is the problem?</h4>

<p>Well the <a href="wordsof.html#Power">problem is</a> that most books are quite bad they teach you stuff like what to buy and they list lots of fish, but they don&rsquo;t teach the basics.</p>

<p>There are 3 general approaches that seem to work as far as planted aquariums go.</p>

<ol>
<li>High tech, high cost approach. See <a href="http://www.dupla.com/">Dupla</a> for more details.</li>

<li>The Phosphate limited approach which I would call medium tech. See <a href="http://www.thekrib.com/Plants/Fertilizer/sears-conlin.html">PMDD</a> for more details.</li>

<li>The low tech, natural aquarium approach. See <a href="http://naturalaquariums.com/">Natural Aquariums</a> site also <a href="http://aquariumplants.net/">Dan
Q's</a> guides.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will summarise the differences</p>

<h4>Other tips</h4>

<ul>
<li>Under gravel filters are useless. They are good if you don&rsquo;t have plants. (like in a goldfish tank)</li>

<li>Carbon dioxide is extremely important for photosynthesis. To conserve CO<sub>2</sub> don&rsquo;t use a filter that agitates the water surface. Don&rsquo;t use an air stone (except maybe at
night)</li>

<li>Carbon filter media is unnecessary. Use it only to remove medicines.</li>

<li>Most commercial plastic hoods a disgrace to the hobby. Buy an expensive wooden one or build your own.</li>

<li>Be very careful buying fish, most fish get too big, are aggressive or eat plants or dig!</li>

<li>Don't trust the pet shop assistant.</li>

<li>Buy as products from the super market as they are much cheaper.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Chemistry</h4>

<ul>
<li>With regular water changes chemistry normally takes care of itself.</li>

<li>Two chemicals Ammonia and Nitrite are deadly to fish, they are produced by fish waist, rotting leaves etc.</li>

<li>If the pH is greater than 7 Ammonia is produced.</li>

<li>If your water is saturated with Nitrate, Nitrite starts to build up.</li>

<li>Plants love Ammonia but can also use Nitrate</li>

<li>The 3 elements that must be in the water column are Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg) and Potassium (K)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pet Shops</h4>

<p>The best pet shops I&rsquo;ve found so far is Exotic Aquarius in Boxburg North and Pet Masters also in Boxburg North. Pic a Pet is about the best in the Vaal Triangle also Pet City is worth
mentioning.</p>

<h4>Links</h4>

<p>The best site is <a href="http://www.thekrib.com/">The Krib</a> it has a huge content with no advertisements or other irritations.<br />
 Check out <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hills/2637/">Hoa G. Nguyen's</a> nice low tech site<br />
