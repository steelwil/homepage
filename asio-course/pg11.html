There are three basic things that need to happen now. We need to:
<ol>
<li>Continue to learn the ins and outs of the boost and asio libraries to further extend our programs.</li>
<li>Write, test, and deploy a reusable wrapper for the base asio networking stuff so we do not have to keep rewriting it.</li>
<li>Write our own networking library on top of the wrapper that handles the protocol specific tasks at hand.</li>
</ol>

In doing so, we will be able to finally harness the full potential of the asio library. There are still a lot of aspects to
the asio library that has not been covered in this guide. That is because this guide was written to be a quick start guide.
While this guide is certainly not short, it just goes to show how much is needed to really get into the asio library.
Hopefully, this guide will provide a good direction to learn the basics of asio from. The biggest issue I have seen when
trying to learn asio is finding practical resources that really cover a lot of the bases of the library so the end user
knows what they need to look into to get the most out of the library.

UDP is not quite as involved as TCP since it is connection-less. However, it is up to the programmer to implement their own layer
on top of UDP specific to their application. As a consequence, no UDP topics are being covered at this time as using the UDP
specific API is pretty straightforward after having looked at the TCP API. Most users might even consider using an existing UDP
library as well. A lot of people do write their own TCP wrappers and then libraries while not many of them end up writing their own
UDP simply based on their needs due to the nature of the protocol. Depending on one's application and networking experience, the
decision will vary.
<br>
<br>
As part of goal #3, we will also want to write a custom "packet" class to use. Such a class was not included in these examples
simply because of the added complexity. Ideally though, we want to have something reusable to build upon and reuse, but depending
on the application this might not be possible. For example, larger scale applications might need code that uses custom memory
allocation interfaces and as a result any code written before might be incompatible. These are important things to keep in mind
when doing network programming!
<br>
<br>
Finally, we have to consider is asio right for us. For some applications, it might be over kill. For others, we might decide
we want to use another library. I myself have come to like the design of asio and willing to accept the overhead incurred
through std::bind for the flexibility and power the library provides. While getting the "perfect" code takes a lot of work and
testing, it is still doable. However, some other libraries might provide more features and an API set suitable for a task.

This guide to getting started with asio is now concluded. Future guides will be written to cover even more topics. Please
