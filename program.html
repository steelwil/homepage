<p>I program using Microsoft's Visual C++, most people find it intimidating but I love it. If you consider using it, just remember it has a very long learning curve but I think it&rsquo;s worth the effort. I think the best choice for the recreational/novice programmer would be Java, which in many ways are superior to VC++.</p>

<p>Java is a cross platform framework, most of your mobile software is written in it!</p>

<p>WTL is a great alternative to MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes), WTL is the way MFC should of been designed in the first place.
I wont ever use MFC again if I can help it.</p>

<p>I am doing a lot of <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> programming lately. It is a cross platform C++ library, so your programs can be easily ported to other platforms like Linux or Mac OSX.</p>

<p>If you want the ultimate in seed, efficiency and size give Assembler programming a go. Yes you can write Windows programs in
Assembler and no its not that difficult. Go to the <a href="http://www.masm32.com/">masm32</a> website and download m32v10r.zip
and you'll be programming in no time.</p>
