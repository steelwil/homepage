<h1>William Bell's Family Tree Introduction</h1>

<p><em>2007-07-29:</em> Updated and added some more photos. If you are not happy with your photo please send me.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to my family tree.</p>

<p>Almost all the information I have received is from the family. This is typically the first phase of a family tree. Once this source of information is exhausted, the next phase would commence, where fees would typically have to be paid for archival services.</p>

<p>I use a free genealogical program called <a href="http://www.gramps-project.org/">Gramps</a>, it runs on the Linux operating system, unfortunately Windoze is not really supported but they are working on it!</p>

<p>One day, I just started filling it in and now I have hundreds of entries! My main area of interest is not so much the ancestors but the possibility of meeting second, third and fourth cousins.</p>

<p>If you feel that some of the information here violates your privacy let me know and I will remove it. I typically do not publish any contact information. Any information can be stored in the database as private, and will never be published.</p>

<p>This is a collaborative work and your help would really be appreciated!</p>

<p>Please send your updates, photos and spelling corrections or whatever to me at <a href="mailto:William.Bell@frog.za.net">William.Bell@frog.za.net</a> and do not be shy even if you think your information is trivial, remember disk space is cheap!</p>

<p>To generate this web site I export my Gramps database to a SQLite database. I then have some php scripts that generate the webpages. The code will all be availability under a GPL3 license in due coarse.</p>
