==Gramps plugin==
copy Sqlite1/ to the following directory
~/.gramps/gramps33/plugins/

export your database to gramps.db

this plugin is based on the existing one shipped with Gramps but generates a lot smaller db as it uses gramps ID's and not big UGI's.

==Web php scripts==
Put all the php files and the images directory in your web site.

Put gramps.db into
../../.sqlite/

Put all your thumbs in
thumb/

Put all your images in
pics/
