<h4>Why this calculator, when so many others exist?</h4>

<p>I am learning WTL which is an extention to ATL. As a learning exercise I decided to make something usefull.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>Can be used to calculate loan data aswell as investment data.</li>

<li>Calculates: Initial Amount - this is the amount you want to loan or the lump sum you have to invest.</li>

<li>Calculates: Final Amount - this is the amount you owe or receive after your investment matures</li>

<li>Calculates: Monthly Installment - this is the amount you must pay per month or the monthly return on your investment</li>

<li>Calculates: Number of Months (Negative months were not tested, but it should work, should you be that weird!)</li>

<li>Calculates: Interest per Year - due to the polynomial nature of the Interest formula some weird (typically negative interest rates) combinations may fail!</li>

<li>Very small about 100KB</li>

<li>Stand alone, no need for any other system files.</li>

<li>Works on Windoze 95, 98, NT, and XP needs a minimum of Internet Explorer 3</li>

<li>No splash screens, irritation screens, adverts or reminders.</li>

<li>Does not write to the registry</li>

<li>And the best of all it's free! Now under the open source GPL license</li>
