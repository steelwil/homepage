<p>Bella passed away on the 5th of November 2007, died of FIP</p>

<p>Bella is our (me and my wife's) cat and this is her home page, dedicated entirely to her.</p>

<p>We have known her since she was tiny. It was the 12'th of March 2003 when we first met. Our old cat <a href="../poppie/pop.html">Poppie</a> had died, and we were on the lookout for another cat, then on that fateful day we saw her, trapped in that overcrowded cage at a local pet shop. We had to save her and payed the hefty price of R10 (less than $2). </p>

<p>To us she was the sweetest, cutest bundle of fur on the planet, she was so happy to be with us and she could of sawed down several forests with all the purring she was doing.</p>

<p>We figured she must of been about 6 weeks old making her birthday around 1'st February 2003.</p>

<p>We decided to get her sterilised, which sounds cruel but is really the best thing you could do for your pet, unless you specifically want to breed. Your cat will be less likely to disturb unsympathetic neighbours who will more likely prefer them dead. An unsterilised cat is more likely to get into fights with stray cats and pick up abysses and diseases. Their life expectancy will as a result be greatly increased.I would say a unsterilised tom may live 3 years if he is lucky, while a well looked after cat may make it all the way to twenty. Another thing you could do to greatly increase their life expectancy is to keep them indoors at night.
</p>

<p>The op was finally done and it went very well, the scar is a lot smaller than in the old days, so Bella recovered quite quickly. We were happy and everything looked set, but it was not long when disaster struck.... or was that curiosity?<br />
