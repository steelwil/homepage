<h3>Words of Wisdom</h3>

<p><em>(Last updated 2003-03-14)</em></p>

<p><em>This page contains a few truths that have applied to my life.</em></p>

<p>A thousand mile journey begins with the first step.</p>

<p>You can choose to see solutions, or you can choose to see doom.</p>

<p>Most men learn from their mistakes, a wise man learns from others.</p>

<p>Most men envy another man's success, a wise man learns from their good example.</p>

<p>Success can be defined as doing the right actions often enough, for long enough.</p>

<p><a id="Power" name="Power">Power</a> equals knowledge, knowledge equals solutions to problems, similarly ignorance equals
problems.</p>

<p>Knowledge increases your options, thus your freedom.</p>

<p>Problems are solved by solutions. (Think about it! Action is required to solve a problem. A problem won&rsquo;t just disappear
by itself)</p>

<p>You are who you perceive yourself to be!</p>

<p>Happy workers equal happy customers (and not the other way round South Africa!)</p>

<p>What one man has done another can do again. (from the film "The Edge")</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be intimidated by a huge challenge think of completing the first tiny step.</p>

<p>Life is a choice: Your life is the sum result of all the choices you have ever made.</p>

<p>Happiness is a choice. There is no rule that says you have to dwell on your failures or shortcomings.</p>

<p>If you are in a difficult situation, ask yourself, what would Jesus do in my situation?</p>

<p>It is better to blame yourself for the worlds problems and try to solve them, than to blame the world for your problems and do
nothing about it.</p>

<p>Pride comes before the fall.</p>
