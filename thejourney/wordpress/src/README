3. Caveats
----------

a. The current version replies on the comment form having <p> tags. If this is not the case for your comment form,
   you may need to modify the code in wp-content/plugins/fc_plugin/fc_plugin.php: replaceText()
   For most cases, no changes are required
b. The plugin currently does a page refresh on every login
