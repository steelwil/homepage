<h2>Water Baptism</h2>

<hr />
<p>Most people get baptised because they feel that is what God is calling them to do. Maybe you are reading this tract because God is calling you to be baptised or maybe you have heard of or seen a baptism and are just curious about it.</p>

<p>This tract aims to explain some of the basic principles of baptism, and why we as Christians should indeed be baptised.</p>

<hr />

<p class="verse"><sub>19</sub> Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <sub>20</sub> and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.
<strong>Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3>Jesus commanded baptism.</h3>

<p>A believers actions or works should be motivated out of love for God, not fear of hell or punishment. Out of this love comes  a desire to please God. It pleases Jesus when we are obedient to his commands.</p>

<p>Jesus commanded many things not because he is God but because he loves us and knows what is best for us, by obeying his teaching we are saying, Yes Jesus you know what is best, I will not lean on my own understanding, I trust your leading.</p>

<p>With obedience our relationship with Jesus improves, we grow to trust him more and Jesus becomes a closer and more intimate friend, to the very end of the age.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Jesus commanded baptism for believers.</h3>

<p>Baptism is for believers. Jesus said ... &quot;make disciples of all nations, baptizing them&quot; ... we can clearly see that he was referring to the converted disciples.</p> 

<p>In order to qualify for baptism we must first become a disciple. (when you become a child of God. i.e. Born-again)</p>

<p>If you were never baptised after becoming a born again believer, you qualify right now for baptism.</p>

<hr />

<h3>The symbolism of baptism.</h3>

<p>Baptism symbolises many things, amongst others:</p>

<p>Baptism symbolises Christ's death and resurrection.
It also symbolises our old life of sin being buried and a raising of a new life in Christ.</p>

<p class="verse"><sub>12</sub> having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, ...
<strong>Colossians 2:12 (NIV)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3>How is a person baptized?</h3>

<p>A person is baptized by full immersion into water.</p> 

<p>The word baptism comes from the Greek word Baptizo.</p>

<p>The definition according to the Strongs Greek dictionary is as follows:</p>

<p>baptizo  bap-tid'-zo; to immerse, submerge; to make whelmed (i.e. fully wet); used only (in the New Testament) of ceremonial ablution, especially (technically) of the ordinance of Christian baptism:--Baptist, baptize, wash.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Baptism is not necessary for salvation.</h3>

<p>You do not have to be baptised to go to heaven. We are saved by grace and not works, baptism is a work. (See the  &quot;Peace with God&quot; tract)</p>

<p class="verse"><sub>8</sub> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--  <sub>9</sub> not by works, so that no one can boast. <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9 (NIV)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3>Still unsure about Baptism?</h3>

<p>Please speak to a friend or somebody that you trust who has been baptised, and ask them what it meant to them. </p>

<p>Pray to God about it, explaining to him all your fears and doubts, ask the Holy Spirit for guidance so that you might have faith to do God's will and have peace about the matter.</p>

<p class="verse"><sub>6</sub> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. <sub>7</sub> And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. 
<strong>Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV)</strong></p>
