		<h3>Christianity</h3>
		<p><em>Background</em>: I am a born-again Christian so you could consider me biased 
			toward it. Feel free to leave if you feel offended. I also add, that I am not 
			about trying to convert anybody, it's more about how I see Christian teachings, 
			Christianity, other religions from a logical point of view. From a religious 
			point of view I would say I am quite a bad Christian, I "sin" constantly, don't 
			attend Church often enough, etc.<br />
			<br />
			If you feel that any of these thoughts contradict sound biblical teaching 
			please <a href="mailto:william.bell@frog.za.net">let me know!</a><br />
