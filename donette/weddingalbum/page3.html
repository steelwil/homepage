<h2>Just Married</h2>

As you can see the car was really something.
We were so happy and I am glad to report that we still are.</p>

My parents were so happy and I have two more parents to add to 
my list.</p>

We had really great friends and family to stand at our side</p>

William is still a little overwhlemed at having gained so many brothers 
and sisters. As you can see, I have a lot and I didn't mind the few extra. It
was and always will be a mad house.</p>

<p>I have to say that it was really tiring having to stand 
there for all the photo's, but I really enjoyed myself. 
I have to mention that I still hate having photo's taken</p>
