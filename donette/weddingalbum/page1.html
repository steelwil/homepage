<p>At this point, my nerves were still under-control.</p>
<p>My parents were really so supportive even though we landed up being rushed to get from Johannesburg to Vereeniging in
time to get ready for the church.</p>

My Bridesmaids and Maid of Honour, made me really feel special.  They were so helpful, and I
don't think that I would have made it to the church on time.</p>

My brother-in-law Kurt really surprised me that day.  When I went to get in the car, instead of
his car standing there(it was supposed to be a BMW), he had organised a White Lexus.  I almost started
crying.  It was a really special thing to do.</p>
