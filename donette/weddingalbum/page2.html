<h2>The Church</h2>

<p>We were married in the Sasolburg Baptist Church.</p> 


<p>When I got to the church, I asked the minister if William was nervous, when I was walking down
the isle, William was wringing his hands together, and I could have
fallen in love with him all over again. If I didn't have my Dad's hand to hold onto I guess I might
have been doing the same.  
What was really nerve racking was the fact that we 
had to stand facing everyone, but it made the ceremony really special.</p>

I don't know who was more nervous my Dad or me.
I think I clutched William's hand so hard during the service, because
I was so scared of messing up my vows</p>

I am so glad we got to spend our day with such wonderful
friends and family.</p>

It was the greatest feeling, when we kissed as husband and wife.  I have
to say thank you to the Lord that he made it possible</p>
