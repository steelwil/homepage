<p>Before we start, first of all Thank You Dad for helping us make our wedding day as great as it was
and then to thank everyone else, who if I had to make a list of you all it could take me forever.
For each and every person there, Thank you for celebrating with us.
Thank you for all the gifts,
I really didn't realise what wonderful family and friends we had until then.  We received almost every kind 
of gift you could think of as well as money which totalled to almost R2500-00. 
It paid for our curtains.
I was really sorry that Christine and Craig could not be there with us, but I know you were thinking about us.
Thank you for all the love and support given by our family and friends  
Hope you can enjoy this tour as much as we enjoyed the Wedding</p>
