<h3>Our Homeschool Journey</h3>

<p>I have been very excited to start homeschooling and have had to really keep myself from pushing My Toddler from doing things before he is ready for them. I have found many good links where I get lots of ideas and activities. In 2007 we purchased Sonlight P3/4, which contains really good books to read to our Little Ones. Some of the books are definitely focused on 3-4 year olds, but many of the stories my 2 year old is enjoying already. I recently purchased the 2 year old curriculum from ABC Home Preschool, and We are really enjoying that so far.</p>

<p>We decided to homeschool, mainly because that is what is on my heart to do. There are many reasons some of them being that the Education department is a shamble. There is constantly confusion about syllabuses and what is important. It is difficult to find a teacher that really loves her job, the classes have too many children, teacher-strikes, total chaos and lack of security in the schools really encourage us to keep our children at home.</p>

<p>The is a lot of negativity about homeschooling, but the only reason people can give me is that my Children will lack socially. To be honest the society we live in is not an encouragement to send my children out there. But aside from that I feel that we as parents need to be totally committed to homeschool successfully. I feel that we as parents need to make sure that our children have the opportunities to socialise in many different environments, but they need to be controlled. At the moment my 2-year-old does swimming in season, will start Kindermusiek, and Playball in July. I also have a playgroup that meets once a week. My Child plays really well with other children so far, and I think if we continue to expose him to other children and activities with rules there will hopefully not be any big issues.</p>
