<p>Completed July 2005</p>
<p>This is my first charcoal drawing that was completed in 2005. This picture was inspired by Matthew 17 v 20 "if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you" (NIV). I didn't draw a mountain but the theme is Faith. My thanks go to Sean Moore for modeling his hands for me to draw</p>
<p><img class="right" src="faith2.JPG" alt="Child of faith" /></p>
<p>Completed Dec 2005</p>
<p>My second picture, Child of faith, represents having the faith of a child and trusting in the Father</p>
<p><img class="right" src="face.JPG" alt="Face" /></p>
<p>Completed Jan 2006</p>
<p>This was my first pastel picture. There was no actual meaning behind this picture, except that I liked it. Decide for yourself what you think.</p>
<p>I was taught and helped along my very talented friend <a href="http://ilsemoore.com/">Ilse Moore</a>. Visit her website.</p>
<p>I have not done anything else since. Elijah hasn't given me time.</p>
